.SH DESCRIPTION
.B libred_init_colour
open a file descriptor, without returning it, to the colour
temperature lookup table, and stores the file descriptor to
.BR libred_fd .
It is necessary to call this function before the first call to
.BR libred_get_colour (3).
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, the function returns 0. On failure,
the function returns -1 and sets
.B errno
appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
The function may fail for any reason specified for
.BR open (3),
and set the value of
.B errno
to the same values.
.B errno
is always set to 0 on success.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
It is possible that the behaviour is changed to loading the
colour temperature lookup table rather than just open a
file descriptor to it.
